# Ruby Classes Lab

Complete this lab after the [Ruby classes lecture](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-delorean/LECTURE_U04_D02_Ruby_OOP)

## More Shape classes!

Remember this [ES6 classes lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-delorean/LAB_U03_D01_ES6-Classes) where we defined shape classes?

We are doing it again!

### Setup

If you have not yet done so

* `gem install bundler`
* `bundle install`

### Work

Look at the tests (but do not edit them).  Edit the files in the `src` directory and make the specs pass!

Do them **in order**: `Shape`, `Triangle`, `Rectangle`, `Square`

Run `rspec test/shape_spec.rb` and make all the test go green.  (Remember you can also run with the `--fail-fast` option).  Then do the other shapes in order.
